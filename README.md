Run ./hw5 dbSmall3.txt or equivalents

As a result recommendations may not be accurate. However, the formula to calculate recommendations are completely correct if Dijkstra's Algorithm produces the correct values. I have implemented the splay tree in order to look up keywords and their corresponding products.
